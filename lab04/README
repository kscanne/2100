In last week's lab we used a stack to check a string
of open- and close- parentheses to see if it was
balanced.  That was a very simple example of what's
called "stack parsing"; basically the idea is that you
use the stack to "remember" the work that you still need
to do to parse or validate the input string.  

This week we'll take this idea one step further, and 
write a validator for the much more complex language
of parenthesized arithmetic expressions; e.g.

43
(5+3)
(9*(2+3))
((11+3)*(4+3))
...

Formally speaking, we say that a string of symbols
is *valid* if either
(1) it represents a positive whole number (like "43" or "1")
or 
(2) it is of the form "(E1+E2)" or "(E1*E2)", where both
E1 and E2 are valid strings of symbols.

Note that the definition is recursive.

Here's an algorithm for checking to see if a given string is valid:

Create an empty stack of char's.
Push the char 'E' onto the stack.
Set a counter i = 0; this is the index of the first
character in the input string.

while (i < length of the input string) {
   Let c be the character in the input string at index i.
   Let s be the character on top of the stack (without popping it yet;
     if the stack is empty, return false)
   If c == ')' and s == ')', pop off the ')' and increment i.
   If c == '(' and s == '(', pop off the '(' and increment i.
   If c == '*' or '+' and s == 'O', pop off the 'O', increment i.
   If c is a digit and s == 'E', pop off the 'E' and 
       increment i until it's not pointing at a digit
   if c == '(' and s == 'E', pop off the 'E', then
       push on ')', then 'E', then 'O', then 'E', then '('.
   In any other case, return false since the string is invalid!
}
If the stack is empty, return true, else return false.

Exercises:
(a) Implement the above algorithm, and test it thoroughly on a
set of valid and invalid input strings.

(b) [Challenge] Modify the algorithm to return the 
integer value of the evaluated expression.
